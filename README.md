### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**TasteTheCC/TasteTheCC** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C, DM, and trying to be comfortable enough with Haskell to leave it alone.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about cats, portuguese academic culture or the nature of life and death
- âš¡ Fun fact: I died once!
